## 🌞 Day / 🌙 Night Mode

Toggle between **Daylight** ☀️ and **Night Sky** 🌙 using the on-screen button.

| Mode              | Description                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **☀️ Day Mode**   | Bright ambient light, clear blue sky, vivid sea, and warm sunlight.        |
| **🌙 Night Mode** | Dim moonlight, cool bluish tones, subtle reflections, and a peaceful mood. |

**How it works:**  
The JavaScript dynamically changes scene lighting, background color, and ambient tone when toggled — no reloads needed.
